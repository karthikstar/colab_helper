# colab-helper
Utility files to help set up colab for experimentation + development

The idea is to let you :

```
! git clone https://github.com/mdda/colab_helper
from colab_helper import utils as utils
```

at the top of a notebook, and have a bunch of useful stuff ready-to-go 
(optionally without flooding your namespace with stuff).
